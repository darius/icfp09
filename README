An entry for the 2009 http://icfpcontest.org/ (team Wili Wáchendon).

Run

  $ ./build
  $ ./runall 2>dbg

The resulting trace files end up in osf/. Currently this only works
on OS X, because dynamic libraries are built in an OS-specific way
(see makemake.py).

You can watch what's happening if you install pygame. Then run, e.g.,

  $ python review.py osf/2004.osf

(It assumes a screen-size of at least 1000x1000.) Or you can watch a
run while it's still being computed, by passing watching=True to the
problem constructor (from run.py).

hohmann.py and its associated mechanics code derives from a C version
by Edward Kmett and me. This has evolved since the contest finished.
